A card counting practice game with three modes.

Normal, Genius and Super Genius.




Normal is based on the High Low system of counting.
2 to 6 -> 1
7 to 9 -> 0
10 to K and A -> -1

after cards are dealt, it'll ask for the count.



Genius mode is based on knowing how many of each blackjack value there are left in the deck.
If the deck left was KH, 2S, AD
You would say there is one Ace left, one 10 card left and one 2 card left.
This will cycle from A to 10 and ask you how many of each value is left in the deck.
This requires using memory techniques to count down the values as they are dealt.


Super genius mode is based on knowing the exact cards left in the deck.
You type them in like AH for ace of hearts and JD for jack of diamonds.
You will type them in one at a time.
This requires memory techniques to remember when a card is dealt, and removing it from your mental list.



TO PLAY

Good luck!
